[[HART]]HART:: Hardware Thread. At machine-mode level, each hart is a real hardware thread, either one hart per core without hardware multithreading, or multiple harts per core with hardware multithreading, and 'hart' represents the hardware resource. It is possible to emulate harts in software; for example, privileged execution environments can multiplex lesser-privileged harts onto physical hardware using timer interrupts.
