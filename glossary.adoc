== RISC-V acronyms and terms

This glossary includes definitions of terms specific to RISC-V in addition to terms that are useful in understanding the architectures and technologies in use by RISC-V contributors and users.

[glossary]
ABI:: Application Binary Interface--abstractions and interfaces for applications that allow interactions without the need to know the details about what takes place in the lower networking layers. For RISC-V, the ABI provides abstractions of S or M modes.
//(I have edited this to be a more generalized definition and still think that S and M modes operate need explanation).

Address field:: Designated as a memory address or a processor register.

AEE:: Application Execution Environment--the environment, from bare metal to full operating system, in which an application runs.

AIA:: RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture; builds upon the interrupt-handling functionality of the basic RISC-V ISA to add support, mainly for the following: message-signaled interrupts (MSIs) from devices, direct control of device interrupts (as MSIs) by a guest operating system running in virtual supervisor mode (VS mode), reducing the reliance on regular hypervisor intervention. additional standard local interrupts for RISC-V harts, intermixing of priorities of local interrupts and device (external) interrupts , and conditional delegation of local interrupts to lower privilege levels, including to virtual machines.

CLIC:: Core-Local Interrupt Controller--A low-latency, vectored, preemptive interrupt controller for RISC-V systems.

CPL:: Cost Per Load.

CPU Cache:: Many CPUs three kinds of caches to speed up data retrieval: an instruction cache for executable instruction fetch, a data cache for data store and fetch, and a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) for virtual-to-physical address translation for executable instructions and data.

CMOS:: Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.

Chemical Vapor Deposition:: A chemical deposition process in which the wafer is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired film.

Consistency Model:: A computing system supports a specific consistency model if operations on memory follow specific rules. For example, high level languages like C++ and Java, partially maintain the contract by translating memory operations into low-level operations while preserving memory semantics. To hold to the contract, compilers may reorder some memory instructions, and library calls like `pthread_mutex_lock()` encapsulate required synchronization.

CSR:: Control and State Register. The standard RISC-V ISA sets aside a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0]) for up to 4,096 CSRs. By convention, the upper 4 bits of the CSR address (csr[11:8]) are used to encode the read and write accessibility of the CSRs according to privilege level.

DM:: Debug Module.

DRAM:: Dynamic Random Access Memory.

eDRAM:: Embedded DRAM.

ELEN:: Element length.

ES:: Entropy Source--an input or a measured characteristic that supplies random bits for an I/O device on a computer, usually used to supply  bits that an attacker cannot know, as part of security.

Flip-flop:: Electronic circuitry with two stable states for use in storing binary data. Data stored in flip-flops is changed by applying specific inputs. Both flip-flops and latches are building blocks that are used in digital computing.

FLOPS:: Floating Point Operations per Second--

GE:: Gate Equivalent.

HART:: Hardware Thread--at machine-mode level each hart is a real hardware thread, either one hart per core without hardware multithreading, or multiple harts per core with hardware multithreading, and 'hart' represents the hardware resource. It is possible to emulate harts in software, for example, privileged execution environments can multiplex lesser-privileged harts onto physical hardware using timer interrupts. Note that co-operative multithreading within the same privilege level is not a compliant implementation. Across all implementation choices, we retain the concept of a hart as a resource abstraction representing an independently advancing RISC-V execution context within a RISC-V execution environment.

HBI:: Hypervisor Binary Interface--an interface abstraction for hypervisors to run.

HEE:: Hypervisor execution environment--the environment in which a hypervisor runs.

Instruction Set:: A group of commands for a CPU in machine language that can refer to all possible instructions for a CPU, or a subset of instructions to enhance its performance in specific situations, and includes:
* Instruction length--which can vary, Opcodes--the command to be carried out.
* Operands--on which the command will operate.
* Registers--internal locations that are limited in number and ability while quick to access.
* Memory--external storage--a larger and more versatile number of locations that are slower to access.

J Extension:: A RISC-V extension that provides a form of sandboxing that can be implemented by the pointer masking proposal where runtime and sandboxed code all run within user mode and the sandboxed code has been checked by the runtime to be unable to change pointer masks.

Latch:: A circuit that has two stable states that is used to store state information, known as a bi-stable multivibrator.

LL/SC:: Load Link/Store Conditional or Load Locked/Store conditional--see LR/SC.

LR/SC:: Load Reserve/Store Conditional, also LL/SC--a pair of instructions used in multithreading to achieve synchronization. Load-link returns the current value of a memory location, while a subsequent store-conditional to the same memory location will store a new value only if no updates have occurred to that location since the load-link. Together, these implement a lock-free atomic read-modify-write operation.

LSA:: Loadâ€“Store Architecture--a design that is architecturally neutral and that uses bit patterns in IEEE 754 floating-point to speed sign extension in ways that simplify the multiplexers in a CPU--by placing most-significant bits at a fixed location.

Non-ISA:: Non-Standard Extension--primarily programmer visible software conventions to ensure interoperability, also including HW external debug protocols that, while important, are not directly visible to programs.

NOR:: Logical NOR, known as Pierce's Equivalent, Quine's Dagger, the ampcheck (from the Greek for "cutting both ways"),  joint denial, or neither-nor, operates on two logical values, typically from two propositions, that produces a value of true if and only if both operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of false if and only if at least one operand is true.

OCF:: Operation Code Feild--specifies the operation to be performed.

OS-level Sandboxing:: A form of sandboxing implemented by the pointer masking proposal. There is no guarantee that sandboxed code cannot modify the pointer mask and therefore the sandbox does not allow modifying pointer masks in user mode.

Page fault:: A type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit (MMU) into the virtual address space of a process.

Photolithography:: In microprocessor manufacturing, a process of using light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask (also called an optical mask) pattern parts to a photosensitive substrate on a thin film (substrate or wafer). The process can also make use of chemical photoresist on the substrate.

Platform:: A System Platform is a set of features users can depend on working together that includes things like ISA Profiles, software components, hardware system components, standardized hardware/software interfaces, and other features. Currently RISC-V has defined two Platform types--OS/A and M (naming TBD).

// please verify.

PQC:: Post-Quantum Cryptography, due to replace RSA and ECC in NIST cryptography [PQC] as well as military [NSA].

Privileged:: Provides security isolation, and a means to reduce code defects because code does not have to check for illegal values. Privileged contains state, is used primarily to run applications and can be used to debug implementations. It defines CSR address space and content  trap when taken increases privilege mode (say from U to S) trap when taken stays at the current privilege mode access more than even M mode. Its addresses reserved in ISA. address includes highest mode that access the CSR and if it is `r/w/rw/none` preserve bits already there when you change a field.

Profile:: (ISA Profile) a set of extensions (instructions, state and behaviors) that users can depend on working together. Extensions are either required, optional, unsupported, or incompatible. RISC-V has defined two Profile types: Application (RVAyy)--appropriate for Linux-class and other embedded designs with more sophisticated ISA needs--and Micro-controller (RVMyy)--appropriate for cost-sensitive application-optimized embedded designs running bare-metal or simple RTOS environments.
//a comment was made that articulating differences between RISC-V profile and ARM profile would be useful. What more needs to be said?

Psuedo Instructions:: In support of a core design goal for RISC-V ISAs--high performance--pseudo instructions often include include special commands to the assembler. The use of pseudo instructions supports a policy of keeping the instruction set as small as possible, while supporting optimization and adding clarity to software programming. For example, the use of a pseudo instruction enables loading into memory with a 32-bit offset (called big) that is not directly available, because only 16-bit offsets are permitted.

PTE:: Page Table Entry--an entry in the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the mapping between virtual addresses (used by the program executed by the accessing process) and physical addresses (used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the RAM subsystem), that enables access data in memory.

RISC:: Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture. Information processing using any of a family of microprocessors that are designed to execute computing tasks with the simplest instructions in the shortest amount of time possible. RISC-based machines execute one instruction per clock cycle as opposed to CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) machines that can have special instructions as well as instructions that take more than one cycle to execute.

Rocket:: Parameterized SoC generator written in Chisel, designed to helps tune the design under different performance, power, area constraints, and diverse technology nodes.

RV:: Reliability Verification--a category of physical verification that helps ensure the robustness of a design by considering the context of schematic and layout information to perform user-definable checks against various electrical and physical design rules that reduce susceptibility to premature or catastrophic electrical failures, usually over time.

RVWMO:: RISC-V Weak Memory Ordering--Default memory ordering model that loads return value written by latest store to the address of the later of in-program and memory order (see specifications for list of axiomatic and operational rules).

SATP:: Supervisor Address Translation and Protection--XLEN-bit read/write register that controls supervisor-mode address translation and protection and holds the physical page number (PPN) of the root page table--an address space identifer (ASID) that facilitates address-translation fences
on a per-address-space basis, and the MODE field, which selects the current address-translation scheme.

SBI:: Sytem Binary Interface--abstracts the interfaces that are required to run operating systems.

Scala:: A statically-typed, general-purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. Designed to be concise, Scala's design aims to address criticisms of Java, and it provides language interoperability with Java so that libraries written in either language can be referenced directly in both Scala and Java code. Scala source code can be compiled to Java bytecode and run on a Java virtual machine (JVM).

SEE:: Supervisor Execution Environment--environment in which operating systems run, which can but are not required to be BIOS style interfaces.

Segmentation fault:: A failure condition caused by a memory access violation in hardware operating with memory protection. The fault process notifies the operating system (OS) that software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory.

SFENCE:: Orders processor execution relative to all memory stores prior to the SFENCE instruction. The processor ensures that every store prior to SFENCE is globally visible before any store after SFENCE becomes globally visible. The SFENCE instruction is ordered with respect to memory stores, other SFENCE instructions, MFENCE instructions, and any serializing instructions (like CPUID instructions), and it is *not* ordered with respect to either memory loads or the LFENCE instruction.

SFENCE.VMA:: (instruction wrapper?)

SHA:: Secure Hash Algorithms--a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard that started with what is now known as SHA-0, a retronym used for the original (1993) 160-bit hash function published under the name "SHA".
